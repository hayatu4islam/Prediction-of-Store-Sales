# Prediction-of-Store-Sales
In this project, we predict store sales using the historical Walmart sales data.

### Problem Statement
In 2014, Walmart hosted a recruiting competition on Kaggle. Job-seekers were provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments, and the task is to predict the department sales for each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an efficient model to forecast sales accurately. To achieve this goal, we need to identify the important factors influencing sales, patterns, and improve the forecast accuracy.
